(ns rdap.status
  "EPP object status → RDAP status, per **RFC 8056**.

  This mapping is specified, not a matter of taste, and it is the place a
  registry most often invents its own. The two vocabularies look similar enough
  that guessing feels safe: `clientDeleteProhibited` obviously becomes
  something like `client delete prohibited`. But the two ends do not line up
  one-to-one, and the places they do not are exactly the places a guess is
  wrong:

  - **`ok` becomes `active`.** Not `ok`. RDAP has no `ok`; a client checking for
    it finds nothing and concludes the domain has no status at all.
  - **The RGP statuses of RFC 3915 are in scope** (RFC 8056 §4), and they are
    what tells a redeemable name from one past rescue. A domain in redemption
    carries both `pendingDelete` and `redemptionPeriod` in EPP, so the
    projection produces both `pending delete` and `redemption period`. A
    registry that maps only the EPP core statuses emits `pending delete` alone
    and has dropped the distinction that decides whether a registrant can still
    get their name back.
  - **RDAP status values are space-separated lowercase**, not camelCase. This
    is the mechanical half and the easy half.

  RFC 9083 §10.2 fixes the value set; anything outside it is not a status a
  client is required to understand, so this namespace refuses to invent one."
