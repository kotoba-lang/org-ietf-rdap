(ns rdap.service
  "RDAP query dispatch (RFC 9082) over an `srs` registry, and the HTTP status
  each answer must carry (RFC 7480).

  No HTTP server here: `handle` takes a method and a path and returns
  `{:status :headers :body}` with the body as plain Clojure data. A Worker, a
  Ring handler or a test all call the same function, and the one that runs in
  production is not a different code path from the one that is tested.

  ## The status code is part of the answer

  RFC 7480 §5.3 and §5.4 are specific, and getting them wrong is not cosmetic:

  - **404 for a name that does not exist**, with an RDAP error body. A 200
    carrying an error object is a response intermediaries cache as success.
  - **The `errorCode` member must equal the HTTP status.** Two places to say
    the same thing means two places to disagree.
  - **`application/rdap+json`**, not `application/json`. Clients content-negotiate
    on it, and RFC 7480 §4.2 requires it.
  - **400, not 404, for a syntactically invalid query.** \"Not a well-formed
    domain name\" and \"no such domain\" are different facts, and a registrar
    automating against the API needs to distinguish a bug in its client from a
    name that is free.

  ## Why `/domain/<name>` and not a search

  RFC 9082 §3.1 defines lookup paths; §4 defines *search* paths
  (`/domains?name=…`) and makes them optional. Search is deliberately not
  implemented here: an unbounded search over a registry's whole namespace is a
  bulk-extraction endpoint, and offering one by accident is how registration
  data leaves a registry in bulk. It is refused with 501 — a documented \"not
  implemented\", not a silent 404 that reads as \"no results\"."
