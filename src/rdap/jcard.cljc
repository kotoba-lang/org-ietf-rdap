(ns rdap.jcard
  "jCard (RFC 7095) — vCard 4.0 in JSON — for RDAP `entity` objects.

  The shape is unusual enough to get wrong silently:

      [\"vcard\", [ [name, parameters, type, value], … ]]

  A two-element array whose first element is the literal string `\"vcard\"` and
  whose second is an array of four-element property arrays. Every property is
  four elements even when three of them are trivial: `parameters` is `{}` when
  there are none, and `type` names the vCard value type (`\"text\"`, `\"uri\"`)
  rather than being optional.

  Two rules that are load-bearing:

  - **`version` must be first and must be `\"4.0\"`** (RFC 7095 §3.3). A jCard
    without it is not a jCard, and parsers reject the whole entity rather than
    the property.
  - **`adr` has a seven-element value array** in a fixed order: post office
    box, extended address, street, locality, region, postal code, country.
    Fields that do not apply are empty strings, not omitted — the position *is*
    the meaning, so a five-element array silently relabels the country as the
    postal code.

  Building this by hand at each call site is how registries end up with
  entities that differ structurally from each other. It is built here instead."
