  "RDAP response objects (RFC 9083) built from `srs` registry state.

  RDAP replaced WHOIS to make registration data *parseable*: WHOIS is
  free-form text that every registry formats differently, and clients parse it
  with regexes that break whenever a registry changes a label. So the value of
  RDAP is entirely in getting the structure right — a JSON body with invented
  member names is a WHOIS response with extra punctuation.

  Three structures carry almost all of it, and each has a rule that is easy to
  miss:

  **`rdapConformance`** must be present on every *top-level* response and
  absent from nested objects (RFC 9083 §4.1). It is how a client knows which
  extensions the server speaks. Repeating it inside an embedded entity is a
  common bug that makes responses larger and no more informative.

  **`events`** is where dates live — there is no `registered` or `expires`
  member. Each event is an `eventAction` from the IANA registry plus an
  `eventDate`. Inventing `\"eventAction\": \"expires\"` instead of the
  registered `\"expiration\"` produces a body no client will read.

  **`entities`** carry contact data as jCard (RFC 7095), which is vCard in
  JSON: an array `[\"vcard\", [[property, params, type, value], …]]`. It is a
  strange shape to hand-build and stranger to get wrong quietly, so
  `rdap.jcard` builds it rather than each call site.

  Everything here is data — plain Clojure maps and vectors. `kotoba-lang/json`
  serializes them, and nothing in this namespace touches HTTP."

  the honest shape for a registry that does not publish registrant contact data
  (which, post-GDPR, is most of them): the entity exists, its role is known,
  and the contact detail is withheld. Omitting the entity entirely instead
  would tell a client there is no registrant."
