  "WHOIS (RFC 3912) — the port-43 text protocol RDAP replaced, rendered from
  the same registry state.

  RFC 3912 is two pages and specifies almost nothing: send a line, read text
  until the connection closes. It defines no response format at all. Everything
  registrars actually parse — `Domain Name:`, `Registry Expiry Date:`,
  `Domain Status:` — comes from ICANN's Registrar Agreement and the gTLD
  Registry Agreement, not from the RFC. So a WHOIS implementation is not
  \"implement RFC 3912\"; it is \"emit the label set every client's regex
  expects\", and the RFC only tells you how to get the bytes there.

  This is kept in the RDAP repository rather than its own because the two are
  one decision with two renderings. A registry that computes statuses twice —
  once for RDAP, once for WHOIS — eventually shows a domain as locked in one
  and unlocked in the other, and the registrant sees whichever they happened to
  query. Both render from `srs.core/info`.

  Two deliberate differences from RDAP:

  - **Statuses keep their EPP camelCase spelling** with the ICANN EPP URL
    appended, because that is what registrar parsers match. RDAP gets the RFC
    8056 space-separated form. This is the one place the two outputs disagree,
    and it is disagreement required by their respective audiences.
  - **Dates are ISO 8601 in UTC.** ICANN requires it, and the historical
    registry-specific formats (`03-Apr-2000`) are the reason WHOIS parsing was
    ever hard.

  New integrations should use RDAP. This exists because port 43 clients still
  exist and a registry that answers RDAP but not WHOIS looks down to them."
